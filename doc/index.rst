horizont: Dynamic topic models
==============================

horizont implements a number of topic models. Conventions from scikit-learn_ are
followed.

The project is focused on making accessible a variety of models for researchers
in the human and social sciences. Those interested in massive corpora may want
to look at variational methods.

The following models are implemented using Gibbs sampling.

- Latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003; Pritchard et al., 2000)

Coming soon:

- Dynamic topic model (Blei and Lafferty, 2006)
- Logistic Normal topic model

Requirements
------------

Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+ is required, in addition to the following packages:

- numpy_
- scipy_
- scikit-learn_

Getting started
---------------

``horizont.LDA`` implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) using Gibbs
sampling. The interface follows conventions in scikit_learn_.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from horizont import LDA
    >>> X = np.array([[1,1], [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 8], [6, 1]])
    >>> model = LDA(n_topics=2, random_state=0, n_iter=100)
    >>> doc_topic = model.fit_transform(X)

Details
-------

Although ``horizont`` uses code written in C (generated by Cython) in its
implementation of LDA, sampling is slower than in pure-Java (MALLET_) or pure
C++ implementations (`GibbsLDA++ <http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/>`_). For
example, ``horizont`` takes roughly twice as long as MALLET_ to fit an LDA model
of the `AP corpus <http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/index.html>`_.

.. testing on 2013-11-01 on ap corpus, 2000 iter: MALLET 2.3m, horizont 5.1m
