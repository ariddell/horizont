horizont: Dynamic topic models
==============================

horizont implements a number of topic models. Conventions from scikit-learn_ are
followed.

The project is focused on dynamic topic models.

The following models are implemented using Gibbs sampling:

- Latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003; Pritchard et al., 2000)
- Logistic Normal topic model
- Dynamic topic model (Blei and Lafferty, 2006)

Getting started
---------------

``horizont.LDA`` implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) using Gibbs
sampling. The interface follows conventions in scikit_learn_.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from horizont import LDA
    >>> X = np.array([[1,1], [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 8], [6, 1]])
    >>> model = LDA(n_topics=2, random_state=0, n_iter=100)
    >>> doc_topic = model.fit_transform(X)

Requirements
------------

Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+ is required, in addition to the following packages:

- numpy_
- scipy_
- scikit-learn_

`GSL <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_ is required for random number
generation inside the PÃ³lya-Gamma random variate generator. On Debian-based
sytems, GSL may be installed with the command ``sudo apt-get install lib-gsl0``.
